# GitHub Workshop
## Overview
GitHub is a code hosting service and a platform for collaboration. It lets you work on projects with people anywhere in the world. Part of the beauty is, you don’t need to know how to code to use GitHub. You can use it to help with coordinating and organizing your projects.

#### Git
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
> Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

A version control system (VCS) is software system for tacking and managing changes on files.

Git is special because it's a distributed VCS. This is different from a centralized VCS in that a copy of a repository can be on multiple machines. This is Git's killer feature. Its decentralized nature allows it to be better suited to faster workflows, cheaper branching and merging, and more robustness.
