# TXRX GitHub Workshop
### Overview
In this workshop, you will  introduce students to GitHub, the most popular git SaaS product for collaboration.

#### Instructor Notes
* Lab computers will need to be setup with Git and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) . Students who choose to use their own laptops will need to have these tools installed as well (we will not be able to troubleshoot issues they may experience on their personal machines)
* Students will need to setup a GitHub account if they don’t already have one
* A demo repository will need to be created for the workshop. We will use this repo to demonstrate the GitHub workflow.
